# [main.whi.hoon](https://mainwhihoon.in/) - Travel, Explore, Dream!

[main.whi.hoon](https://mainwhihoon.in/) is a travel blogging/portfolio website to share travel blogs, tutorials and my journals. This blog is developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Setting up the app

1. Install ruby using [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/ubuntu_rvm) in your system. Installing the stable version is suggested.

2. After successfully installing ruby, install Jekyll and Bundler gem:

    ```bash
    gem install jekyll bundler
    ```
    If you're on macOS, you may want to add `-n /usr/local/bin` to specify executables' directory. See [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#jekyll--macos) for explanation.

3. Fork this repo and clone your forked repo, by running the `clone` command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/devbae-blog.git
    ```

4. Open the directory, and install the dependencies using bundler:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

5. Update the bundler:

    ```bash
    bundle update --bundler
    ```

6. Run the jekyll app:

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

7. The app is now running at <https://localhost:4000>.
